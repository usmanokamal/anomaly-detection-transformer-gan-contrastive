# anomaly-detection-transformer-gan-contrastive

Overview
This repository contains an anomaly detection framework that integrates contrastive learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address overfitting in multivariate time series data. The framework utilizes data augmentation techniques with geometric distribution masks, a Transformer-based Autoencoder, and a contrastive loss to achieve superior performance in anomaly detection.

Features
